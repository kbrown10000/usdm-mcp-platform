# V26.7 Golden Baseline Archive

This directory will contain the preserved v26.7 working codebase as a reference and fallback.

## Purpose

- **Reference Implementation** - Working authentication and PowerBI integration
- **Fallback Safety** - Preserved working state if refactoring issues arise
- **Migration Source** - Components to be migrated to new platform structure

## Contents (To Be Copied)

Core working components from the current v26.7 implementation:
- Authentication (MSAL device code flow)
- PowerBI integration
- Working tools and configurations
- MCPB packaging
- Railway deployment setup

This ensures we never lose the working v26.7 baseline while building the new platform.
